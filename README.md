# Forget Me Not - Chrome Extension

Forget Me Not is a web application that allows you to create custom reading lists from Chrome and receive them as an email newsletter.

_This extension is still under development. Please use the website's built-in form for the easiest way to save articles to your reading list. I will add instructions soon to run the extension in dev mode_

**Note:** The form to manually add articles can be found on the Reading List page. Simply copy and paste the URL into the form and it will be added to your reading list and newsletter.
